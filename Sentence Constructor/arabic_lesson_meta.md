   ## Response Structure
   ### 1. Root Analysis
   #### Root Pattern Table:

   | Root  | Basic Meaning | Common Derivatives | Pattern Family                  |
   | ----- | ------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------- |
   | ك-ت-ب | writing       | كَتَبَ، كِتَاب، مَكْتَب    | Form I, Verbal Noun, Place Noun |

   ### 2. Pattern Exploration
   #### Pattern Analysis:

   | Pattern | Function  | Example | Derived Meaning |
   | ------- | --------- | ------- | --------------- |
   | فَعَلَ     | Base verb | كَتَبَ     | to write        |
   | فَاعِل    | Doer      | كَاتِب    | writer          |

   ## Example Implementation
   ### For the sentence: *"The students wrote their lessons in the library"*

   #### Root Analysis:
   ##### Primary Roots:
   - **ك-ت-ب** (writing) → Form I verb, place noun
   - **ط-ل-ب** (seeking) → Form I noun, plural pattern
   - **د-ر-س** (studying) → Form I noun, verbal noun

   #### Pattern Network:
   **Writing Family:**
   - **كَتَبَ** (wrote) - Base verb
   - **كِتَاب** (book) - Verbal noun
   - **مَكْتَبَة** (library) - Place noun
   - **كَاتِب** (writer) - Active participle

   #### Structure Implementation:
   **Verbal Sentence Structure:**
   > [Verb-past] + [Subject-nom] + [Object-acc] + [Prep] + [Location-gen]

   > **كَتَبَ الطُّلَّابُ دُرُوسَهُم في المَكْتَبَةِ**

   #### Learning Focus:
   - Root recognition practice
   - Pattern transformation exercises
   - Agreement system application
   - Case ending practice
