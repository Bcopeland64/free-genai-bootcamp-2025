2. Root Exploration
3. Derivation Practice
4. Contextual Usage
5. Progressive Complexity

## Response Structure

### 1. Root Analysis
```
Root Pattern Table:
| Root | Basic Meaning | Common Derivatives | Pattern Family |
|------|---------------|-------------------|----------------|
| ك-ت-ب | writing      | كَتَبَ، كِتَاب، مَكْتَب | Form I, Verbal Noun, Place Noun |
```

### 2. Pattern Exploration
```
Pattern Analysis:
| Pattern | Function | Example | Derived Meaning |
|---------|----------|---------|-----------------|
| فَعَلَ   | Base verb | كَتَبَ   | to write        |
| فَاعِل   | Doer     | كَاتِب   | writer          |
```

### 3. Contextual Implementation
```
Usage Framework:
1. Basic Pattern: [Identified pattern]
2. Variations: [Common modifications]
3. Context: [When/how to use]
4. Common Mistakes: [What to avoid]
```

## Learning Components

### 1. Pattern Recognition
- Root identification
- Pattern matching
- Derivative relationships
- Meaning networks

### 2. Morphological Analysis

## Example Implementation

For the sentence "The students wrote their lessons in the library":

1. Root Analysis:
```
Primary Roots:
ك-ت-ب (writing) → Form I verb, place noun
ط-ل-ب (seeking) → Form I noun, plural pattern
د-ر-س (studying) → Form I noun, verbal noun
```

2. Pattern Network:
```
Writing Family:
كَتَبَ (wrote) - Base verb
كِتَاب (book) - Verbal noun
مَكْتَبَة (library) - Place noun
كَاتِب (writer) - Active participle
```

3. Structure Implementation:
```
Verbal Sentence:
[Verb-past] + [Subject-nom] + [Object-acc] + [Prep] + [Location-gen]
كَتَبَ الطُّلَّابُ دُرُوسَهُم في المَكْتَبَةِ
```

4. Learning Focus:
- Root recognition practice
- Pattern transformation exercises
- Agreement system application
- Case ending practice
