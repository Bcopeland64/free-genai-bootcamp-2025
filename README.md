# ExamPro GenAI Bootcamp - Brandon Copeland

Welcome to my personal repository for the free ExamPro GenAI Bootcamp! I'm using this space to document my journey and share my work as I learn to build generative AI applications in the cloud.

## About This Repository

This repository is where I'll be storing all the code, diagrams, and resources I create and use throughout the bootcamp. Think of it as my digital notebook for the course. Here you'll find:

*   **Code Examples:** My implementations of the concepts we cover, with comments and explanations.
*   **Diagrams and Visualizations:** Visual aids to solidify my understanding of complex topics.
*   **Supporting Materials:** Links to documentation, articles, and tools that I find helpful.
*   **Experimentation:**  Don't be surprised if you see some experimental code or notes as I try things out!

## Bootcamp Overview

The GenAI Bootcamp will cover the following topics (this is a sample, please adapt it based on your actual bootcamp content):

*   **Module 1: Introduction to Generative AI:**
    *   What is Generative AI?
    *   Key Concepts and Terminology
    *   Applications of Generative AI
*   **Module 2: Cloud Fundamentals for GenAI:**
    *   Overview of Cloud Platforms (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP)
    *   Setting up a Cloud Environment
    *   Essential Cloud Services for GenAI
*   **Module 3: Large Language Models (LLMs):**
    *   Understanding LLMs
    *   Using Pre-trained LLMs
    *   Prompt Engineering Techniques
*   **Module 4: Building GenAI Applications:**
    *   Developing applications using LLMs
    *   Integrating GenAI with other services
    *   Deployment and Scaling
*   **Module 5: Ethical Considerations and Best Practices:**
    *   Bias and Fairness in GenAI
    *   Responsible AI Development
    *   Security and Privacy

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```
    git clone [repository URL]
    cd [repository name]
    ```

2.  **Explore the Modules:**  Browse the directories for each module to see my progress and the resources I'm using.

## Why I'm Doing This

I'm excited to learn about GenAI and build some cool projects.  I'm hoping this bootcamp will give me a solid foundation in [mention your specific goals, e.g., "using LLMs for creative writing," or "building AI-powered tools for my business"].  Follow along to see what I learn!
