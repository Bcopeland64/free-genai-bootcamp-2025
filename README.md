<h1 style="color:blue;">ExamPro GenAI Bootcamp - Brandon Copeland</h1>

Welcome to my personal repository for the free ExamPro GenAI Bootcamp! I'm using this space to document my journey and share my work as I learn to build generative AI applications in the cloud.

<h2 style="color:green;">About This Repository</h2>

This repository is where I'll be storing all the code, diagrams, and resources I create and use throughout the bootcamp. Think of it as my digital notebook for the course. Here you'll find:

*   **Code Examples:** My implementations of the concepts we cover, with comments and explanations.
*   **Diagrams and Visualizations:** Visual aids to solidify my understanding of complex topics.
*   **Supporting Materials:** Links to documentation, articles, and tools that I find helpful.
*   **Experimentation:**  Don't be surprised if you see some experimental code or notes as I try things out!

<h2 style="color:green;">Bootcamp Overview</h2>

<h2 style="color:green;">Getting Started</h2>

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```
    git clone [repository URL]
    cd [repository name]
    ```

2.  **Explore the Modules:**  Browse the directories for each module to see my progress and the resources I'm using.

<h2 style="color:green;">Why I'm Doing This</h2>

I'm excited to learn about GenAI and build some cool projects.  I'm hoping this bootcamp will give me a solid foundation in [mention your specific goals, e.g., "using LLMs for creative writing," or "building AI-powered applications"].
